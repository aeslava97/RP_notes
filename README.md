###### Quick tips
* track your macros regularly 
* know how much protein, carbs and fat you take daily or weekly
---

## Food Composition
* Protein Sources:
  * Lean Meats
  * Lean Dairy Products
  * Lean (high quality) Vegan Sources
* Carb Sources:
  * Veggies
  * Fruits (fresh)
  * Whole Grains
    * Inc. whole grain breads
* Fat Sources:
  * Monounsaturated-heavy sources
  * Olive/Canola oil
  * Nuts, Nut Butter
  * Avocado
    * Might not be a ton of these, as many fats will come from protein or carbs

## Macro Amounts
* Protein Intake:
  * 1g per lb (1 protein = 4cals) per day is a good idea
  * 150lb person = 150gr of protein daily
* Fat Intake:
  * 0.3-0.5 gr of fat (1 fat = 9 cal) per lb 
  * 45 gr <= 150lb person <= 75 gr per day
  * more than 0.5 gr of fat wont impinge excessively on carbs at the **start** of the diet
* Carb Intake:
  *  Whatever is left from protein and fat
  *  (CALORIES - protein - fat) / 4 = carbs
### Notes
* As long as yo get your protein and fat is between 0.3 and 0.5 gr, you can have whatever ratio of carbs-fat
* More carbs if you want more energy
* More fats if you want to enjoy the food more 

## Meal Number
* 3-5 meals:
  * Stave off hunger
  * Provide energy for daily tasks
  * Provide energy for training
* You want to spread your meals:
  * A meal within a few hours of waking up
  * A post-workout meal
  * A meal every 6 hours at least
  * A meal within 2 hours of bedtime
* Macros Per Meal
  * Protein can be pretty even
  * Carbs should precede a workout and be post workout
    * with fewer at other times
  * Fats should stay away from workouts
    * but placed before non-eating intervals

## Supplements
* Whey Protein
  * Can be used intra and after workout with carbs
* Casein Protein
  * Can release slowly before bed or busy times
  * Full of dairy products
* Creatine
  * Works well
  * start a week before fat loss phase, until end of fat loss
  * it will temporarily increase your weight
* Stimulants
  * Caffeine is most common
  * Use as little as needed

## The Fat Loss Path
#### Goal -> Lose 0.5% to 1% body weight per week *over* 6 to 12 weeks (6-9 for begginers, 9-12 for experienced)
* Calorie Cuts:
  * 500 calories down from baseline diet = 1lb loss per week
  * 750 calories down from baseline diet = 1.5lb loss per week
  * 1000 calories down from baseline diet = 2lb loss per week
#### Caloric Cut YOU need:
* (current bodyweight) * %(weight loss per week) * 500 = daily calories needed to cut
* 150lb * 5% * 500 = 375 daily calorie deficit

#### How
* Try to get half the "cut" by adding activity
* Cut as much of the rest by cutting fats
  * until fats get to 0.3gr per lb
* Cut whatever is left from carbs
* If you go 2 weeks without losing the weight you planned per week:
  * cut additional 250 cals

## Tips:
* Fitting your macros:
  * Cook on bulk, prepare most of your meals in 1 day so you dont have to think about calories
  * If you cant eat your prepared meals, you are travelling for example, have a plan (fruits, nuts, protein bars)
* **Hunger**:
  * Eat more filling foods
    * veggies, fruits, yogurt, very lean protein sources
  * Eat less tasty foods 
    * sometimes super tastier food makes you hungrier
  * Choose bigger meals during predictably hungrier times
* Water weight problems:
  * Sometimes you may store more and more water while losing tissue
    * may be causes by stress, sleep more, stress less!
    * we tend to want saltier food when hungry, watch your intake and keep it stable
    * we tend to drink more sweet drinks when hungry   

## Maintenance
#### When your fat loss diet finishes, you are not done dieting, now its maintenance diet
1. Stick to your diet foods
    1. dont go on junk foods yet
1. Add 50% of your deficit BACK
    1. add this all in diet foods, not junk
1. Watch your weight
    1. you should gain about 2% just from post-diet water weight
    2. as soon as you drop below that number, add in 250 cals
1. Stablize
    1. It should happen around 3 to 4 weeks 
    2. No more adjustments
    3. You wont really be very hungry or cravey anymore
    4. you will be eating plenty of diet food and maintaining at below 102% of your post-diet weight
1. Introduce Junk
    1. After you feel stable you can have a fun treat here and there
    2. just remain active, if your weight trends up for two weeks, ease up on the snacks and clamp down on your daily fats just a bit
    3. its going to take another 3-4 weeks to adjust with the introduction of junk food
#### Maintenance phase lasts at least the same amount as the weight loss phase to not regain the weight back
